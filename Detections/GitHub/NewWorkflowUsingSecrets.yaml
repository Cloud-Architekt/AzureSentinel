name: 'New GitHub workflow is using secrets - Historic allow list'
description: |
  'This detection builds an allow list of historical usage of secrets by Workflows and compares to recent history, flagging growth of secrets use which are not manually included in the allow list and not historically included in the allow list of workflows. This is to determine if someone is hijacking or use secrets in other workflows.'
